Meanwhile, Daisuke Sorai had just reached his long-sought goal of becoming an aerobatics pilot only to injure his leg, crushing his chances at ever becoming a member of the elite Blue Impulse flying team. He gets assigned to the force's public relations desk and subsequently finds himself attached to Rika in the role of attendant. Sorai and Rika differ on just about everything; their views, their mindset. But they share one thing: their childhood dreams have been shattered and they've hit a wall in life. From there, a mutual understanding begins to germinate, drawing them toward each other and toward the discovery of a new dream.",

He’s absolutely sure that he’s a wonderful standup comedian, who wound up in this boring, humiliating job purely by chance.\n\nManagement is constantly trying to fire him, his employees despise him, yet he is ever the optimist, and he talks in catch phrases lifted from the most banal management books. He is surrounded by the range of characters that make up the impossible mosaic of Israeli society.
